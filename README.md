## Story Generation with NanoGPT


In this project, I'm implementing a language model designed to generate stories. The model is trained on TinyStories sourced from Hugging Face, utilizing the nanoGPT architecture. This version of nanoGPT features 2 billion parameters, making it well-suited for story generation tasks.


## Dataset
